# Generative CSS

Generative Css is a site that generates backgrounds using CSS3's `radial-gradient` and `linear-gradient` properties. The way it works is that it builds the css for 1-11 radial gradients, and 1 linear gradient, and chains it all together to one rule for `background` and sets the background to that rule.
